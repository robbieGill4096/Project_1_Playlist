When the program starts it will ask the user for input about the songs they wish to add to the playlist.  in order of (``title``, ``artist``, ``play time (mm:ss)``, ``file name)``.

The``PlayList`` will then print out the AveragePlayTime, Song with playtime closest to 240 seconds, and finally the song title artist playtime and file names, are printed in ascending order to the user.
